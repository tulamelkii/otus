You can build the kernel in a container like https://github.com/naftulikay/docker-ubuntu-kernel-build. You cannot boot with the built-in kernel because the container reuses the system kernel.

Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. 
When discussing the difference between images and containers, it isn't fair to contrast them as opposing entities. Both elements are closely related and are part of a system defined by the Docker platform.
Images can exist without containers, whereas a container needs to run an image to exist. Therefore, containers are dependent on images and use them to construct a run-time environment and run an application.
